                    Sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice flavoured with vinegar and
                    a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in
                    sushi abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating clientele, and the dish
                    has gained popularity in the United States and elsewhere (see also sashimi). Nigiri-zushi is a
                    hand-formed oblong of rice topped with sliced raw seafood and a dab of wasabi (a green paste made of
                    true wasabi or horseradish); the ingredients of oshi-zushi are pressed to shape in a mold.
